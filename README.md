# Python3 HTML-parser (form table on websites)

That module help you to parse HTML-table from any websites.
You have to change some piece of code for better work.

In the bottom you have to change <b>url</b> variables. Need to copy here your own url with table for parse<br>

In line <b>table_string = soup.find('table', id='tab_main1')</b> you have to change tag <b>table</b> or not and also change <b>id</b> of your tab element (you can replace id to class, but you don't need to write <b>id</b>, only write class name)
